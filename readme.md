# The Bufallo Field
This repository contains documentation and software related to the Bufallo Field.

The Bufallo field is a strong momentum field which embeds all massive particles.
The strong nuclear force and the gravitational force can be derived from it.

## Key words
quantum gravity, Strong nuclear force, Bufallo Field, Bufallo, Bufallo Booster, Reid profile, Schwarzschild metric,

## Description
The document 'The Bufallo Field.pdf' explain how to derive the gravitational and strong nuclear forces from the Bufallo Field, a strong momentum field.
The software provides a function to calculate the strong nuclear forces between two neutrons and recalculates the Reid profile

## Installation
